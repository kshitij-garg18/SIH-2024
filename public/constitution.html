          <h2>Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            The Indian Constitution is the supreme law of India. It was adopted
            by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949 and came into
            effect on 26th January 1950, marking the country's transition to a
            republic. The Constitution is a comprehensive document that sets out
            the framework and principles of governance in India. It establishes
            the structure and powers of the government, delineates the
            fundamental rights and duties of citizens, and safeguards the
            democratic values and principles on which the nation is built. It
            also provides for a system of checks and balances, ensuring a
            separation of powers among the three branches of government. The
            Indian Constitution is known for its resilience and adaptability,
            having been amended several times to reflect changing social,
            political, and economic realities. It is a testament to the
            democratic spirit and aspirations of the Indian people.
